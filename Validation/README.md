Welcome! Here is a Validation project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will write code to validate fields of an account creation form.<br>
You will write code that makes sure you entered a valid username, email address, phone number, and password, as well as make sure their password field matches their confirm password field.

Try it out!
